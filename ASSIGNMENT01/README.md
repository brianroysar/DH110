## Accessible and Sustainable Transportation in Jakarta, Indonesia

*by Brian Roysar | DH 110: User Experience Design*

### About The Project

This project will focus on the 11th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG), **Sustainable Cities and Communities**, established by the United Nations (UN) as a way to achieve a "shared blueprint fot peace and prosperity for people and the planet" by 2030. The project will be focusing on a small subset of this overarching goal which is the creatiion of more accessible and sustainable transportation in Jakarta, Indonesia.  

Having lived in Jakarta my entire life, I've experienced first-hand how inefficient transportation and commuting can be. A lack of structured roads and public transportation being in its early stages of development, the lack of accessible and efficient transportation has frustrated many Indonesians as commute times and congestion are both exponentially high. In addition, with Indonesia being in the top-20 most polluted countries in the world, there should be a larger emphasis on improving the sustainablity of many of our transportation methods to maintain a good quality of life in the long term
