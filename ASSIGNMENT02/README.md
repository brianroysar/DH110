# ASSIGNMENT #02: Pilot Usability Testing (UT)
_by Brian Roysar | DH 110: User Experience Design_

## Introduction
In this assignment, we will be conducting a Pilot UT on mrtjakarta.com - the official website for the MRT system in Jakarta, Indonesia. The main purpose of UT is to gague a system's ability to meet the following three metrics: 

1. **Effectiveness**: Accuracy and completeness with which the users complete their desired goals
2. **Efficiency**: How fast and fluently a user can perform the desired tasks
3. **Satisfaction**: How content the users feel after completing or attempting to complete tasks

## Methodology
To perform the UT, there are three phases we have to compelte. First, we have to design and prepare the UT material which involves writing the orientation script and Google form that includes the consent form, questionnaires, tasks to complete and more. Secondly, we have to conduct the UT, but for now, we will only be conducting it with one other person as it is a pilot study. Lastly, we want to document our UT by providing the evidence, summary and reflection of the experience. 

We will be performing the tests on the main pain points discovered in the initial heurisitc evaluation which are:

1. Finding and updating routes that a user wants to travel
2. Obtain information about the development and background of the MRT system
3. Navigating in and out of the e-procurement subpage

This pilot UT will be done by a friend as the participant with me acting as the moderator. We will take the test, while screen recording and recording our faces/voices to record responses through verbal and physical cues. I will be using **Zoom** to record the camera footage as well as screen record. The test was created using **Google Forms**.
