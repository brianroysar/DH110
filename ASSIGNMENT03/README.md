# ASSIGNMENT #03: Learning from people in context
_by Brian Roysar | DH 110: User Experience Design_

## Step 1: Research goal + requirements

### **What is the main activity your project would support for the users?**

Encourage the use of the public transportation system in Jakarta, Indonesia by providing users with more accessible and easy-to-digest information about available routes and the system as a whole. 

### **What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity? (reference)**
Referring to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, this activity will serve three different goals which are:

1. **Physiological needs**: accessible transportation for people to obtain resources such as food (grocery shopping, restaurants), water, and travel to places of shelter (homes, apartments, hotels)
2. **Safety needs**: accessible transportation enables people to commute to their workplaces which allows them to obtain economical security
3. **Love/social belonging needs**: accessible transportation enables people to commute to social gatherings with friends and family, allowing them to feel more connected and a stronger sense of social belonging

### **What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
The existing solutions for accessible transportation range from using the official websites of independent transportation systems (MRT or bus) and utilizing generic navigational apps such as Google Maps to discover different ways to get from place to place. 

### **What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?**
The current limitations are that the official websites of each public transportation system are independent from each other, hence forcing users to cross-reference multiple websites to obtain information about their desired route. In addition, despite the fact that applications such as Google Maps integrate multiple systems in one place, it is not well integrated with real-time updates on possible delays/alterations to routes.


## Step 2: Target users

### **What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme)**

User demographic: any person of age to travel alone on public transportation, citizens and tourists, potentially more focused on people that depend on public transportation for commuting to and from work
User preference: people seeking cheaper and/or more sustainable ways to commute and travel
User expertise: mainstream; no required level of expertise


### **In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity?**
Users would do this at home before going about their commute, or when they reach the station and attempting to decide where to get off/transit/change systems. Users would need to look and find routes when they are planning their way to work, social gathering, exploring the city and anything else that requires them to commute.

### **What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity?** 
Users can discover information about their routes through the websites and applications previously mentioned. More traditional commuters could also refer to physical, static maps that are posted on the stations, and manually find their routes that way. 

## Step 3: Research methods and plan
There are a plethora of research methods that range from being close to participants to being distanced and detached. To obtain the most holistic responses, I have chosen to conduct a mixture of interview and participatory observation. This means that the research will involve questions that I ask about the user’s background, experiences and struggles with the problem, and also observe how they currently solve the problems. The interview and activity will be conducted virtually as I am not in Jakarta, and this acts as a geographical/physical barrier to doing it in-person. It will take place 6-10pm to allow participants to do this after their work hours. Finally, for data collection, we will record audio and video from the interview as well as have a digital note taker during the interview to keep track of the notable pieces of information.

## Step 4: Interview/observation guide
