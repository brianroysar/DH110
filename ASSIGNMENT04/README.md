# ASSIGNMENT #04: Persona + Scenario
_by Brian Roysar | DH 110: User Experience Design_

## Purpose of UX storytelling
UX storytelling is essential for us to detach our own thoughts, wants, emotions from the problem we are trying to tackle; it forces us to reshift our perspective to a plethora of different users perspectives, and from that exercise, we are able to have a more hollistic understanding of the problem and how we will solve it. It ultimately allows us to be in the shoes of potential users in the real world and make the product focus more on the user's needs and goals. In my project, as someone who does not use public transportation as much, it would be very useful to explore perspectives of people that potentially use the system more, as they are the ones who will interact and use the product more often. In addition, since public transportation is utlized by many people that come from many different backgrounds (not just one niche demographic), UX storytelling will allow us to understand the large and wide market that our product is dealing with.
