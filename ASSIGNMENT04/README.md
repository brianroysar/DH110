# ASSIGNMENT #04: Persona + Scenario
_by Brian Roysar | DH 110: User Experience Design_

## Purpose of UX storytelling
UX storytelling is essential for us to detach our own thoughts, wants, emotions from the problem we are trying to tackle; it forces us to reshift our perspective to a plethora of different users perspectives, and from that exercise, we are able to have a more holistic understanding of the problem and how we will solve it. It ultimately allows us to be in the shoes of potential users in the real world and make the product focus more on the user's needs and goals. In my project, as someone who does not use public transportation as much, it would be very useful to explore perspectives of people that potentially use the system more, as they are the ones who will interact and use the product more often. In addition, since public transportation is utilized by many people that come from many different backgrounds (not just one niche demographic), UX storytelling will allow us to understand the large and wide market that our product is dealing with.

## Tasks
1. **Integrated Route-Finding:** Allows users to find routes that utilize multiple transit systems (Bus, MRT, Train) all in one application. User will also have multiple inputs that they can use to tailor their search (source/destination, time, system preferences, areas to avoid (safety), intermediate stops along the way)
2. **Recommended Activities:** Presents users with fun things to do, restaurants/cafes, tourist attractions and more that are located along their route and/or nearby their final destination

## Scenario
### Scenario #1: Aditya's Scenario
Aditya wants to find a new, faster way to commute to work since his original commute is often delayed which causes him to be late to work. He lives in East Jakarta, whereas his work is located in the Central Business District which is located in South Jakarta. Because of the distance, his commute requires the use of multiple lines and systems, which thus requires a lot of transits between stops. Thus, Aditya wants to find the most optimal route that gets him to work in the shortest time possible with the least amount of transits.
