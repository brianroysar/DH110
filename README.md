# DH110: User Experience Design

# TELEPORT
## Encouraging the use of Jakarta’s Public Transportation
### Brian Roysar | DH110 | 22F

## Introduction
This project will be centered on the 11th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG), Sustainable Cities and Communities, established by the United Nations (UN). In particular, this project will be focusing on encouraging the use of Jakarta’s public transportation system that includes the newly built MRT, Transjakarta Bus, Train and more. Being the 17th most polluted country in the world, in addition to Jakarta’s average Air Quality Index (AQI) of 110, there should be a larger emphasis on reducing the city’s reliance on private modes of transport, and instead improving the sustainability of many of our public transportation methods to maintain a good quality of life and society in the long term. In addition, having lived in Jakarta my entire life, I've experienced first-hand how inefficient transportation and commuting can be. A lack of structured roads and public transportation only being in its early stages of development, the lack of accessible and efficient transportation has frustrated many Indonesians as commute times and congestion are exponentially high.
