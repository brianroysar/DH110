							<p class="card-text">
								Being the 17th most polluted country in the world, in addition
								to Jakarta’s average Air Quality Index (AQI) of 110, there
								should be a larger emphasis on reducing the city’s reliance on
								private modes of transport, and instead improving the
								sustainability of many of our public transportation methods to
								maintain a good quality of life and society in the long term. In
								addition, having lived in Jakarta my entire life, I've
								experienced first-hand how inefficient transportation and
								commuting can be. A lack of structured roads and public
								transportation only being in its early stages of development,
								the lack of accessible and efficient transportation has
								frustrated many Indonesians as commute times and congestion are
								exponentially high.

							<h3 class="card-title">Design Statement</h3>
							<p class="card-text">
								Due to the mix of old, legacy transportation systems, such as
								the train, combined with pre-mature new systems such as the MRT,
								there is a lack of cohesion when it comes to finding information
								about routes that utilize multiple systems at once. This means
								that users will often have to cross reference many different
								websites and resources to plan out their route that they want to
								travel, or resort to Google Maps which does not have real time
								updates on information such as arrival/departure times, delays
								and cost of route. This acts as a barrier for people to oftenly
								use the public transportation system as they find it difficult
								and troublesome to find their way around. Thus, I want to create
								an application that integrates all the information from all the
								different public transportation systems, and allow users to find
								their desired routes, in addition to fun/recommended things to
								do along the way.

								Before we start on ideating and designing the application we
								want to build, I conducted an analysis on existing solutions for
								the same problem. This involved performing a heuristic analysis
								on two similar websites
								<a href="https://jakartamrt.co.id/en" class="link-primary"
									>https://jakartamrt.co.id/en
								</a>
								and
								<a href="https://transjakarta.co.id/ " class="link-primary"
									>https://transjakarta.co.id/ </a
								>, where I applied the 10 Usability Heuristics of User Interface
								Design and provided Severity Ratings for each heuristic. From
								this, I recognized how difficult it is to navigate through the
								websites, non-uniform and bland design, and the large amounts of
								unnecessary clutter that the website has.
							</p>
							<p class="card-text">
								After this, I conducted Usability Testing on
								<a href="https://jakartamrt.co.id/en" class="link-primary"
									>https://jakartamrt.co.id/en </a
								>, where I had someone interact with the website, survey their
								initial thoughts, and complete a set of tasks. From this
								activity, I was able to gauge the effectiveness, efficiency and
								satisfaction of the website’s user experience from the
								perspective of a potential user that might not be initially
								familiar with the website. From the testing, I was able to learn
								more insights on what I should improve on in my application and
								also the positives that I should keep in my application’s user

								To learn more about a user’s wants and needs, I conducted user
								research that was detached from any existing applications.
								Through this user research, I gave the interviewee freedom to
								complete the given tasks in the way they normally would. This
								involved a mix of interview and participatory observations,
								where I would ask them questions on how they go about using
								public transportation and observe how they do it. From this
								exercise, I was able to learn more about the user’s priorities
								and preferences. For example, I learn that they prioritize the
								necessary, simple information about the route, while also their
								desire to learn more about things to do on the side.

								To understand the potential users that will be using the

								tackle. It forces us to reshift our perspective to a plethora of
								different users perspectives, and from that exercise, we are
								able to have a more holistic understanding of the problem and
								how we will solve it. It ultimately allows us to be in the shoes
								of potential users in the real world and make the product focus
								more on the user's needs and goals. In this exercise, I created

								At this point, I have decided on the two features that I want to
								prototype which are:
							</p>

							<ol>
								<li>
									Integrated Route-Finding: Allows users to find routes that
									utilize multiple transit systems (Bus, MRT, Train) all in one
									application. User will also have multiple inputs that they can
									use to tailor their search (source/destination, time, system
									preferences, areas to avoid (safety), intermediate stops along
									the way)
								</li>
								<li>
									Recommended Activities: Presents users with fun things to do,
									restaurants/cafes, tourist attractions and more that are
									located along their route and/or nearby their final
									destination.
								</li>
							</ol>

							<p>
								Using Figma, I created a low-fidelity prototype that roughly
								sketches the barebone structure and logical flow of the
								application for the two features aforementioned. Through this
								quick prototyping method, I was able to assess what is feasible
								and not, while creating a good foundation to build future
								iterations on
							</p>

							<p>
								Using the Lo-Fi Prototype, I also conducted testing to see if a
								user would find the structure and flow easy to understand, learn
								and use. Through this, I was able to verify the elements that
								worked smoothly, but also obtain observations on certain flows
								and elements that seemed unclear to a new user.

			<p>
				After creating the high-fidelity prototype, I was able to perform a cognitive walkthrough on the application. Through this I was able to understand how a user would interact with the app while obtaining first impressions from potential users. This was also a quick and efficient way to obtain feedback and criticism on how I could improve and fix the application's user experience. The key takeaways from the cognitive walkthrough were:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li> User Interface is clean, simple and easy to use </li>
				<li> Navigation through the application is easy to follow </li>
				<li> Requires more emphasis on carbon emissions saved. This could be achieved through a an overall daily, weekly and monthly total of how much a user saves on emissions. </li>
				<li> List of hobbies to choose from is too long and overwhelming. This could be solved through implementing a search/filter feature. </li>

			<h3> Conclusion </h3>
          <p>
            This project was my first time conducting and applying a human-centered design process and it showed me the importance of having the user in mind throughout the entire journey. Having a clear goal in mind, while also having multiple insights from potential users, it made the designing process much smoother and directed as designing felt more objective rather than open-ended.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout the process, I have gained many valuable skills that I will continue to use in the future. Activities such as usability testing and user research allowed me to develop interviewing skills as well as preparing interview material such as the script and Google Form. Creating the low-fidelity prototype, interface design and high-fidelity prototype gave me the opportunity to improve my Figma skills, while familiarizing myself with the many useful plugins that Figma provides such as Arc, Stark and Autoflow. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The most challenging part of the process was the interface design, as I found it difficult to choose a specific design that I felt content with. It required a lot of iteration, and testing out different combinations of shape, color, typography. However, after thinking about which of these factors would be most appropriate for the application, it became a lot easier to decide. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Moving forward, I would love to have the chance to explore more functionalities that Teleport could incorporate, such as a social or safety feature, and expand the prototype as well. I would also want to perform Usability Testing on my prototype to gain even further insights on what can be improved on. Finally, I would also spend some more time creating designs for the potential notifications that a user would receive when they have this application installed, such as route information, safety alerts, and recommended activities. 
          </p>
